    <h1>Print() your first statement in Python</h1>
    <p>As a begginer to python, it is always a good idea to start with learning how to make your first print() statement. </p>
    <p>A print statement is a one-liner, which involves the word "print" followed by a pair of parantheses(). You place the statement you want to print within the parantheses. The print() statement is a function, which we will get to later.</p>
    <h1>Printing a sentence</h1>
    <p>To print a word or a sentence, you type your desired sentence within double quotes "" within the parantheses.</p>
    <p>The following example code prints out the statement "Hello World!" to the screen or any other output device you are using.</p>
    <pre class = "code-block">
        <code>

        print("Hello World!")
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h1>Printing numbers</h1>
      <p>You can print numbers, as shown in the following example:</p>
      <pre class = "code-block">
        <code>
            
        print(5)
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h1>Using print() for basic aritmetic operations</h1>
      <p>You can also do some basic arithmetic operations like addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*) and division (/). You can run the following code by copying and pasting it into the <a class ="in-line" href = "https://www.w3schools.com/tryit/trycompiler.asp?filename=demo_python">backend editor for Python</a> by w3schools.</p>
      <pre class = "code-block">
        <code>
            
        print(5+5)
        print(5-3)
        print(5*3)
        print(10/5)
        </code>
      </pre>
