    <h1>Python Comments</h1>
    <p>When programming in python, comments can be used to explain your code.</p>
    <p>Programmers use comments to make their code more readable.</p>
    <p>If you want to make a comment, use # followed by the comment you want to make. Python will not execute your comment, that is, anything typed after a # is ignored by the language.</p>
    <p>For Example:</p>
    <pre class = "code-block">
        <code>
            
        #This is how you make a comment
        #Printing "Hello World!"
        print("Hello World!")
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>To make multiline comments, you need to insert a # for every new line. For example:</p>
      <pre class = "code-block">
        <code>
            
        #This is line 1
        #This is line 2
        #This is line 3
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>Comments are not always used to explain code, it can also be used to prevent python from executing a piece of code. This helps with <a href = "../Appendix.html"> debugging</a> your code. In the example below, the first line is not executed whereas the second line is executed:</p>
      <pre class = "code-block">
        <code>
            
        #print("Hide this line")
        print("Show this line")
        </code>
      </pre>
