    <h1>Python Indentation</h1>
    <p>Indentation is the addition of white spaces at the beginning of a statement/block of code. </p>
    <p>In most programming languages, indentation is used just for readbility but in python, it is syntactically important. In python, indentation is used to "indent" code blocks.</p>
    <p>You can indent code blocks using tabs or spaces in your keyboard, but the number of spaces must be uniform in a block of code.</p>
    <p>Using an <a class ="in-line" href = "../../LearnSomePython/loops/ifLoop.html">if loop</a> to demonstrate an example:</p>
    <pre class = "code-block">
        <code>
            
        #You can use tabs or spaces in your keyboard to indent your code
        #Using an if loop to exceute the code within in if the condition is satisfied
        if 3 == 3:
            print("Hello World!")
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>Here, we are using an if loop with a condition (3 = 2 + 1) and if t he condition is satisfied, the code block within it will execute. </p>
      <p>When you have multiple diffierent code-blocks, you need to indent them seperately as shown:</p>
      <pre class = "code-block">
        <code>
            
        if 3 == 3:
            print("Hello World!") 
        if 10 > 9:
                print("Hello World!")
        </code>
      </pre>
